# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Convert the homepage from displaying all donor sections inline to a navigation-based layout where sections are accessed individually through clickable links.

**Planned changes:**
- Replace inline donor sections on homepage with a navigation menu showing section links/buttons
- Implement section navigation state to display only the selected section's content when clicked
- Add a back/home button to return from section details to the main navigation menu
- Preserve Add Donor functionality and make it accessible from the section menu or Total Donor List view

**User-visible outcome:** Users will see a clean homepage with section navigation buttons. After clicking a section (Total Donor List, Blood Requirement, Appointed Donors, Temporary Rejected Donors, or Permanent Rejected Donors), only that section's details appear. A back button allows returning to the section menu.
