# Specification

## Summary
**Goal:** Fix the error occurring in the Add Donor section to enable successful donor addition.

**Planned changes:**
- Debug and resolve errors preventing the Add Donor dialog from functioning properly
- Fix form submission and validation issues in the Add Donor form
- Ensure the addDonor mutation correctly handles backend responses and updates the UI
- Verify backend addDonor function properly validates input and returns appropriate responses
- Ensure newly added donors appear in the donor list after successful addition

**User-visible outcome:** Users can successfully open the Add Donor dialog, fill in donor information (name, blood group, phone number), submit the form without errors, see a success notification, and view the newly added donor in the donor list.
